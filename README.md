CLASSMATEACADEMY
================

Classmate Academy is an initiative of IITians to prepare the students in all spheres of life. We at classmate academy emphasise on overall improvement of the student.  For the past few years because of the overly competitive corporate educational institutions the high school education systems have become overly biased towards mechanising the students to score in the exams rather than imparting knowledge and application oriented education.  But Competitive entrance examinations play a major role in students getting into the most prestigious institutions today, taking that into consideration we are provideing IIT Ramaiah crash course (IIT Ramaiah Entrance Coaching) for 10th completing students immideately after 10th class exam are over, that is in summer. The growing importance of these entrance exams suggests the need for students to undergo extra training to face such exams confidently.  Our main aim is to impart quality professional education and meeting the rising expectations of young students in Andhra Pradesh. CLASSMATE ACADEMY has been striving to achieve the objective of pursuit of excellence in the fields of Engineering, Medicine and Arts.
